# Client Management System
This web application was developed using Spring Boot and ReactJS. Right now it implements basic CRUD features in order to manage clients' data.

The data are stored in MySQL database. Hibernate ORM was used for the mapping between the model and the relational db.

Javascript's Axios HTTP Library was used in order to make the REST API calls from the react app.

To start the application:

Make sure that Spring Boot app as well as MySQL Server are running, then start the react app (node.js and npm are required) by running:

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
